# TridentPlus
 350x650 Voron Trident
#Notes
This is an advanced build. Please don’t try this for your first build. It is not easy and takes some mechanical skills. The lead screws on two of the Z motors need to be cut and all of the extrusions were drilled in-house on a drill press — there are no stock numbers for pre-drilled extrusions provided.
Getting 2 build plates level and aligned well enough to do a Z_TILT_ADJUST is not easy.
It’s printing!
I’ll update this site in the next week with STL files, CAD and some basic bullet points about the difference between this and the stock Trident (there isn’t much)
#3D CAD
When I’m done and have it built and it is working, I’ll release the CAD/STL files. For now, here’s an online version for your viewing pleasure. https://autode.sk/3JmR1mI

#Goals
Build a printer with a print size of approximately 350Y x 650X x 220Z.
Re-use all Trident parts, where possible, so I don’t have to re-invent the wheel.
Update Trident parts minimally, where needed.
#Ideas/Plans
Use 4 Z integrated lead screw motors in each corner for the Z, reusing all the plastic Trident bed parts, including the MGN9 rails.
Axis will be rotated 90 degrees. Looking from the front, the print size will be 650 wide (x) with the gantry open on the right.
Corner posts and bottom base extrusions will be upgraded to 4040.
The long axis (x) will be upgraded to MGN12 rails.
Printer will be enclosed to print ABS.
AL print bed will be 2 350mm magnabeds with 2 heaters on the bottom. 2 PEI WhamBam sheets will be used side-by-side for the print surface.
Add 16ga steel backers to X & Y extrusions for rigidity.
#Possible Issues
Belts are approximately 2.5 meters. How will they work/stretch, etc?
Gantry is 20mm extrusion — is this rigid enough? Will MGN12 rails and backers make them rigid enough?
How fast can it print? Hopefully 150mm(ish)
Will the bed be too heavy for the steppers?
Will the 20mm bed rails be rigid enough?
